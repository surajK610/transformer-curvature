    The experiments in this app show layerwise curvature modeled as a function of the number of repeated sequences. 
    
    We test sequences that are 
    1. **random** (i.e. randomly generated tokens)
    2. **patterned** (i.e. patterned tokens that are individual characters)
    3. **top100** (i.e. patterned tokens that are the top 100 most frequent tokens)
    4. **bottom100** (i.e. patterned tokens that are the bottom 100 most frequent tokens)
    
    The number of repeated sequences is varied from 1 to 100. We use [transformer-lens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens)
